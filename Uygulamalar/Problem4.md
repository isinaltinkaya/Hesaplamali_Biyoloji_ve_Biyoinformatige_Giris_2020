## Problem 4

Splicing out introns, part one


Here's a short section of genomic DNA:
ATCGATCGATCGATCGACTGACTAGTCATAGCTATGCATGTAGCTACTCGATCGATCGA
TCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCATGCTATCATCGATCGATATCGATGCATCGACT
ACTAT
It comprises two exons and an intron. The first exon runs from the start of the
sequence to the sixty-third character, and the second exon runs from the ninety-
first character to the end of the sequence. Write a program that will print just the
coding regions of the DNA sequence.


Splicing out introns, part two


Using the data from part one, write a program that will calculate what percentage
of the DNA sequence is coding.
